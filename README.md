# ml3-tweetminiproj

In this mini project we are doing the Disaster Tweet challenge - we want to predict whether a Tweet is referring to a real disaster or not. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started
We will utilise exploratory data analysis, transform the text a bit, and build an LSTM model to predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster!
